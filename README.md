# O-setter
An AI tool for orienteering course setting. Project as part of the Building AI course to create orienteering courses for orienteering competitions.
## Summary
The intention with this project is to create a tool that will interpret orienteering map

## Background
Beeing a course setter for an orienteering competition is a time consuming job. There are many different classes, based on the participants age and desired difficult level. To have AI help to set the course on a theoretic level (you must always visist the forest the check the reality) will be a big help for the course setter that usually works for free. 

## How is it used?
It will be used by experienced orienteering runners and course setters. The input should be an orienteering map, competition category, a list of different classes and their difficult levels. Output should courses printed on the map. 
Input for difficult levels and course lengths can be the Swedish Orienteering Federations guide lines: https://orienteringse.sharepoint.com/sites/SOFT-Externt/Delade%20dokument/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FSOFT%2DExternt%2FDelade%20dokument%2FHemsidan%2FF%C3%B6rening%2FArrang%C3%B6r%2FBanl%C3%A4ggning%2FSt%C3%B6ddokument%20%26%20filer%2FKlasser%5Fsvarighetsnivaer%5Fberaknade%5Fsegrartider%5Fsamt%5Fbanlangder%5F20230322%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FSOFT%2DExternt%2FDelade%20dokument%2FHemsidan%2FF%C3%B6rening%2FArrang%C3%B6r%2FBanl%C3%A4ggning%2FSt%C3%B6ddokument%20%26%20filer&p=true&ga=1 

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources can come from scanned orienteering maps or available maps with courses on the Internet. There are sources where orienteering runners have uploaded their GPS tracks from different competitions.  

## Challenges
To gather the data source (maps with courses). 
Make the system understand the map and how to create optimal courses with multiple route choices.
It should understand different terrain types and how they can be used for the course setting. 
Cooperation with GPS tracking services online is probably necessary.

## What next?
- Gather data
- Develop protype
- Establish cooperation with existing online tools?
